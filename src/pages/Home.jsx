          In a bizarre twist of fate that has left the fantasy baseball
          community in stitches, local resident Alex Papadatos is gearing up for
          a crucial playoff matchup against his arch-nemesis and brother,
          Dennis. However, Alex’s preparations have taken a painful turn after a
          day of basking in the sun led to an epic sunburn that has left him
          looking more like a boiled lobster than a strategic fantasy baseball
          player.

          “It was supposed to be a relaxing day at the lake,” Alex lamented,
          visibly wincing as he adjusted his shirt to accommodate his fiery red
          shoulders. “I thought I could skip the sunscreen just this once. Who
          knew UV rays had a vendetta against me?”
        </p>

          While his teammates in the fantasy league had spent the week pouring
          over stats and analyzing player matchups, Alex spent the previous
          Saturday basking in the sun, sipping lemonade, and grilling hot dogs.
          Little did he know, the combination of his fair skin and a lack of SPF
          50 would lead to a face-off far more intense than he had anticipated.

          Warburg Pincus bought the company from middle-market private equity
          firm Sterling Investment Partners in 2017 for an undisclosed amount.
          Sterling had held Service Logic since 2012, growing the company
          through 11 add-on acquisitions during its five years of ownership.{" "}

          As the fateful matchup approaches, Alex’s sunburn has become the talk
          of the town. “It’s hard to take him seriously when he looks like he’s
          just returned from a week-long beach vacation in the Bahamas,” Dennis
          quipped, chuckling as he revealed his own team roster filled with
          power hitters. “I mean, how can you focus on fantasy baseball when
          your rival looks like a walking sunburn advertisement?”
