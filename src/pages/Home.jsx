          The US-based private equity firm Leonard General Atlantic has
          purchased heating, ventilation and air-conditioning company Service
          Logic from fellow private equity giant Warburg Pincus.{" "}

          Terms of the transaction were not disclosed but earlier estimates by
          Bloomberg put the potential deal value at approximately $1.9 billion.

          Service Logic is among the largest HVAC companies in the U.S. The
          75-year-old Charlotte, N.C.-based business owns a network of 26
          service providers nationwide, mostly concentrated in the eastern half
          of the country. It has changed ownership through a series of private
          equity deals several times over the last decade.
        </p>

          Warburg Pincus bought the company from middle-market private equity
          firm Sterling Investment Partners in 2017 for an undisclosed amount.
          Sterling had held Service Logic since 2012, growing the company
          through 11 add-on acquisitions during its five years of ownership.{" "}

          Following the sale to Leonard Green, Service Logic will continue to be
          led by Chief Executive Craig Steinke, who has held the role since
          2013. In a statement, Steinke said his company would work with Leonard
          Green to drive both organic and inorganic growth through new
          acquisitions.

          “Our investment philosophy is to partner with world-class management
          teams to support market-leading companies with multiple ways to grow,”
          Leonard Green Partner Chris McCollum said in a statement. “Service
          Logic exemplifies this market leadership in the commercial HVAC
          services space, making it an ideal fit. We are excited to partner with
          Craig and the entire Service Logic team in supporting the next phase
          of the company’s growth.”

          The firm is currently investing out of its eighth flagship fund — a
          headline-grabbing $12 billion megafund closed in December of last
          year.
